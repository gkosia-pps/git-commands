Tags are used to store a spevific version of repo without merge it to main (without release it)
The idea is to store a version in order to have a reference to it 

1. git checkout <repo>
2. git tag <tag name>: simple tag
OR 
git tag -a v1.0 -m "the message of tag": Annotated tag
3. git show v1.0: to see details about the tag
4. git push origin v1.0

To delete tag:
    git tag -d v1.0: delete tag
    git push origin -d v1.0: delete tag from remote


Checkout from a tag:

    git checkout -b <branchname> <tagname>

Create tag from old commit:

    git tag v1.3 <commit id>
    git push --tags
